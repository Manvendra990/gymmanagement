# Power Cave — NestJS + Prisma + MySQL Setup

## 1. MySQL
Create an empty database:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE power_cave CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
```

## 2. Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm install
copy .env.example .env   # Windows
# cp .env.example .env  # macOS/Linux
```
Edit `.env` and set your MySQL password, a strong JWT secret, and a strong
`SUPER_ADMIN_KEY`. The API requires that key in the `x-super-admin-key` header
when creating accounts; the mobile app has no signup screen. Provision an
account by calling `POST /api/v1/auth/register` with `name`, `email`,
`password`, and `type` (`online` or `offline`). Keep the key in the super-admin
tool only; never include it in the Flutter app. For example:
```http
POST /api/v1/auth/register
Content-Type: application/json
x-super-admin-key: <SUPER_ADMIN_KEY>

{"name":"Gym Account","email":"owner@example.com","password":"<password>","type":"offline"}
```
Then:
```bash
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
npm run start:dev
```
API base: `http://localhost:3000/api/v1`

## 3. Flutter
The default API URL targets the backend on port 3000 from an Android emulator
(`10.0.2.2` maps to the host computer). You can also set it explicitly:
```bash
flutter run --dart-define=API_BASE_URL=http://10.0.2.2:3000/api/v1
```
For physical Android devices over USB, use adb reverse so the device points to your computer:
```bash
adb reverse tcp:3000 tcp:3000
flutter run --dart-define=API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/v1
```
For Wi‑Fi/device-server access, replace `127.0.0.1` with your PC's LAN IP, example: `http://192.168.1.25:3000/api/v1`.

Important: `127.0.0.1` points to the phone itself, not the backend server running on your laptop/desktop.

## Production
Use HTTPS and a production `DATABASE_URL`. Run `npx prisma migrate deploy`, `npm run build`, then `node dist/main.js` (or PM2). Keep `.env` out of Git. Back up MySQL and the `backend/uploads/` directory.

## Data safety
Online account business data is stored in MySQL. Offline accounts, including
the built-in demo account (`demo@gmail.com` / `123456`), keep business data
in the app's local SQLite database and do not synchronize with the server.
SharedPreferences stores session metadata and the online JWT. Member images for
online accounts live in `backend/uploads/`; their paths are stored in MySQL.
Uninstalling the mobile app deletes offline demo data, but does not delete
server business data.
